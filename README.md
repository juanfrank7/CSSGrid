# Rows and Columns

## Getting Started
1. In this exercise you're going to structure rows and columns to achieve the example layout.
2. In the `images` directory you will find the project example image for the element layout for this project. 
3. You can use your own images and verbiage.
4. Really look at the example and visualize how the rows and columns are being structured to place the elements on the page.
5. Use the `.row` and column (`.col-`) classes found in the CSS file for your row and column layouts.

## Requirements
1. Link the CSS style sheet in your HTML.
2. Create _ONE_ style rule to center all `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags.
3. Color only `<h1>` tags.
4. Find an image and resize it if needed so it fits nicely on the page. The example image is 280px x 280px.
5. Link the provided image or your own image to your `<img>` tag.
6. Add some background colors for the different sections.
7. For the footer, layout the text elements as displayed in the example. Visualize the different rows and columns that will be needed to achieve this.
